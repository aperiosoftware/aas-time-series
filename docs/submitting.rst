Submitting an interactive figure to AAS Journals
================================================

.. warning:: This package is still under development and interactive figures
             produced here are not yet ready to be submitted to AAS Journals.

To include an interactive figure in your paper, first make sure you export
the interactive figure(s) you have produced to a zip file::

    fig.save_interactive('my_figure.zip', zip_bundle=True)

The workflow to include your figure in the paper will be added here in the near
future.
