Interactive time series figures in AAS journals
===============================================

About
-----

The **aas-timeseries** package is being developed as part of a project between
`AAS Publishing <https://journals.aas.org/>`_ and the `Astropy Project
<http://www.astropy.org>`_. The goal of this project is to provide astronomers
with all the tools needed to make it possible for astronomers to read in and
manipulate time series in Astropy, produce interactive figures, and easily embed
these in a paper. As part of this project, we are also developing the
`astropy-timeseries <http://astropy-timeseries.readthedocs.org>`_ package which
provides classes to represent time series as well as tools to read these in from
files and to manipulate the time series.

This package is still in development, but it is already possible to try out some
of the functionality. If you run into any issues or would like to request
features, please head over to our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/aperiosoftware/aas-timeseries/issues>`_.
